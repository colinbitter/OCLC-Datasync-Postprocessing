# OCLC-Datasync-Postprocessing
Refine OCLC Datasync Bibliographic Processing Reports with Python

OCLC-Datasync-Postprocessing.py targets text files in the downloads folder in windows. The first text file in the folder will be processed. OCLC-Datasync-Postprocessing.py retrieves the most recent OCLC#, checks if the record is held by your institution, and then makes comparisons between the OCLC#s in each column.
