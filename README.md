# OCLC-Datasync-Postprocessing

OCLC-Datasync-Postprocessing.py targets text files in the downloads folder in windows. The first text file in the folder will be processed. OCLC-Datasync-Postprocessing.py retrieves the most recent OCLC# from WorldCat using bookops-worldcat, checks if the record is held by your institution, and then makes comparisons between the OCLC#s in each column.
Contact OCLC to set up the WorldCat Metadata API for use with bookops-worldcat.
